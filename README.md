#SnakeGame
I recently developed a Snake Game using Java, which allowed me to explore various programming concepts, graphics handling, and event-driven programming. 
The game involves a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and its own tail.
The project includes key components such as the game board, snake, food, game logic, user input handling, and a game loop.
I implemented score tracking, levels with increasing speed, and obstacles to enhance the gameplay experience.
Additionally, I added a high score feature for a competitive element.
This project was a great opportunity to practice fundamental programming skills and provided a solid foundation for creating more complex games and applications in the future.
